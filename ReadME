In this project, an 8-point radix 2 decimation in time (DIT) and decimation in frequency (DIF) method will be used to create the structure for an inverse fast fourier transform (IFFT). 
The design is pipelined to shorten the crucial period, further increasing the IFFTâ€™s efficiency.
In conclusion, Verilog, a hardware description language used for digital circuit design, is utilized to create both the pipelined and IFFT versions.
